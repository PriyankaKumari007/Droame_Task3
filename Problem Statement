EXPLANATION OF PROBLEM STATEMENT IN BRIEF

In this problem, we are given a 2D plane represented as an M x N grid. 
We need to design an algorithm that guides multiple drones flying autonomously to their respective destinations without any collisions. 
The input to the algorithm includes the number of drones and their starting and ending positions along with the time at which they will start.
